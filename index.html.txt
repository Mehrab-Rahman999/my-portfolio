        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! I’m Mehrab Rahman, a passionate Materials and Metallurgical Engineering student at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) with a strong interest in advanced research and software engineering. My academic journey has been complemented by extensive research experience, particularly in areas such as molecular dynamics, nanocomposites, and additive manufacturing. Currently, I am working on cutting-edge projects including atomistic simulations of carbon nanotube composites and data-driven discovery of dimensionless numbers and governing laws from scarce measurements to predict fatigue life. This work involves developing and training models based on the Buckingham Pi theorem to derive physically meaningful relationships from data, with high accuracy predictions for fatigue life in alloys.

In addition to my research background, I have a solid foundation in software development and currently serve as a Senior Frontend Engineer at Codervai.com, where I help build a world-class e-learning platform. With expertise in frameworks like Next.js, React, and tools like Docker and AWS, I thrive in creating dynamic, user-centric web applications. I am also proficient in developing real-time systems and predictive models through deep learning, applying my skills to robotics and control systems.

Beyond academics and professional work, I’ve been involved in exciting hardware projects, such as building “LEO – The Dog,” a quadruped robot with cognitive abilities, and designing efficient heat exchangers. My work has been recognized through various accolades, including a NASA Space Apps Challenge win.

I am always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and research that push the boundaries of technology and engineering.</p>
